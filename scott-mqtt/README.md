# scott-mqtt

Parser from SMOOL format to CMW and SFTM data, by using MQTT.

Note: since the CMW messages specification and online brokers are in constant evolution, ask INDRA partners in SCOTT project for detailed implementation and usage. Also the SFTM, owned by Tecnalia, is a proprietary development, so it is not provided here.

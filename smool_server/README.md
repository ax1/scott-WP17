# SMOOL SIB (Server)

The server for the SCOTT project was a modification of the official SMOOL server, intended for usage in low resources devices, like a raspberry PI.

It is always better to have the latest server (with updates and security patches) which can be downloaded from [here](https://bitbucket.org/jasonjxm/smool/downloads/). In case 
 low resources is required, disable unnecessary bundles in the `/configuration/config.ini` file. You can disable REST, LOG and Connector you do not uues (for instance, leave TCP and disable Bluetooth and others).
